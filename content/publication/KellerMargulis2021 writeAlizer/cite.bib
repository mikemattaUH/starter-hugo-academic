	abstract = {Existing approaches to measuring writing performance are insufficient in terms of both technical adequacy as well as feasibility for use as a screening measure. This study examined the validity and diagnostic accuracy of several approaches to automated text evaluation as well as written expression curriculum-based measurement (WE-CBM) to determine whether an automated approach improves technical adequacy. A sample of 140 fourth grade students generated writing samples that were then scored using traditional and automated approaches and examined in relation to the statewide measure of writing performance. Results indicated that the validity and diagnostic accuracy for the best performing WE-CBM metric, correct minus incorrect word sequences, and the automated approaches to scoring were comparable, with automated approaches offering potentially improved feasibility for use in screening. Averaging scores across three time points was necessary, however, in order to achieve improved validity and adequate levels of diagnostic accuracy across the scoring approaches. Limitations, implications, and directions for future research regarding the use of automated scoring approaches for screening are discussed.},
