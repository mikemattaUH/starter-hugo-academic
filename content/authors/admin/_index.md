My name is Michael Matta, and I am a research scientist in educational measurement in the PASS Lab. My research interests include the development and validation of automated methods of academic skills and behaviors of school-aged students. I have also examined the negative consequences of test bias of traditional and automated assessments of academic skills on educational decisions against students from historically marginalized groups. I am the Project Coordinator for the IES grant aimed at developing [writeAlizer](https://github.com/shmercer/writeAlizer/blob/master/README.md), a free and open-source computer program for the automated scoring of student writing performance.
